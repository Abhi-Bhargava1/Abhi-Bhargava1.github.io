My most recent experience involved interning at Amazon as a software engineering intern. I interned in the Amazon Ads division of Amazon, in the cloud division (Amazon Marketing Cloud). Not only was I able to enhance my coding skills, but I learned a lot about what it's like to be a software engineer and learn a lot about the microservices that Amazon uses. My project at Amazon involved both front-end and back-end work, which was initially tough for me as I had very little front-end experience. My project was essentially developing an end-to-end website in JavaScript to aid Amazon Advertising clients with generating custom specifications for
advertiser data tables, which were tables that advertising companies used to keep track of data collected from their websites.
