Last year I was really interested in options pricing and learning how to become a quant. I decided to learn more about options and C++ by building a basic options pricing system using the Black-Scholes equation. My program would also graph the greeks based on random spot prices for different stocks, and it was really cool to see how these various factors depended on each other. I was also able to learn more about Monte-Carlo simulation (which was used to price the options). Building this project allowed me to also undertake more advanced projects using this as a building block.
