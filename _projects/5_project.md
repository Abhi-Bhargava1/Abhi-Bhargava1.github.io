I built this project for CS 3110. It was my first group project in an agile development setting. We built a poker game (standard Texas Hold'em) that users could play with friends. There were also bots available should a user wish to play alone (customizable based on difficulty). 

It was really fun to work on this project- I learned a lot, and developed an interest in poker. Unfortunately, this caused me to lose quite some money to some friends!
