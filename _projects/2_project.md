Last summer, I had the opportunity to intern at Morgan Stanley as a derivatives trading summer analyst in the equities division. This was my most interesting internship by far, as I got a taste of what it's like to be a full-time trader. I learned a ton about options and met some really interesting people, and it was great to learn skills which one simply can't pick up in a textbook. I really feel like I was able to utilize my skills from school - not only coding related - in a stressful environment. This internship involved rotating on 3 different desks, which was super cool because I got exposed to a lot of different environments/strategies/ways of thinking.
