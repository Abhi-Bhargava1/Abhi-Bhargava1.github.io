I spent the summer of 2021 interning at UBS as a software engineering intern. My motivation in applying for this internship was that I was interested in learning how trading software is built. My project involved developing a system to organize various indication of interests based on clients' trading needs. I used the q language for this project- I had no experience with it before, but it's a mixture of a functional programming language and a query language (i.e, SQL) which I thought was really interesting. The only drawback of this internship was that it was remote; I did get to spend a summer at home though which was really fun.
