I worked on this project freshman year with some friends for the Cornell 2020 Makeathon. We built a automated rocket design system- Given a couple of parameters based on users' inputs, we would output a CAD design for a rocket that the user could then 3d print and use for experimentation. My specific role was to build the GUI system of the project. This was one of my first hackathons- it was super fun and I learned a ton!

We were fortunate enough to place in the top 5 and won some cool t-shirts!
